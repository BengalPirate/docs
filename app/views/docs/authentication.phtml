    Appwrite provides authentication for many different use cases to fit the needs of developers. 
    Appwrite manages authentication with a combination of accounts and sessions. 
    Accounts can be created in many different ways, such as through an anonymous session, email and password, OAuth authentication, magic URLs, and more.

<p>
    The Account API operates in the scope of the currently logged-in account and is usually used in a frontend or mobile app. The Users API is used in backend integrations and uses an API key with access to all your project users.
</p>

<p> 
    Some of the Account API methods are available from Server SDKs when you authenticate with a JWT. This allows your Server SDK to perform actions on behalf of a user.
