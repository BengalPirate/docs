<p>You can use Appwrite to build both client and server integrations. Client integrations are for frontend and mobile applications, which use Appwrite's Client APIs and <a href="/docs/sdks#client">Client SDKs</a>. Server integrations, including the Appwrite CLI, are for backend and CLI applications which use Appwrite's Server APIs and <a href="/docs/sdks#server">Server SDKs.</a></p>

<p>When building client integrations with the Client SDKs, you authenticate with an account and operate in the scope of the account. This means Client SDKs can only access resources that your account has been granted permission to access.</p>

</ul>

<p>When building server integrations with the Server SDKs, you operate in the scope of an API key instead of an account. API keys are created with scopes that specify the type of resources they can access and the type of operations they can perform on those resources. API keys bypass permissions and can access all resources belonging to any account.</p>
