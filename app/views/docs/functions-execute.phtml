<p>
    Appwrite Functions executions can be invoked in several ways.
    Functions can be invoked through the Appwrite SDK and visting its REST endpoint. Functions can also be triggered by events and scheduled executions.
    Here are all the different ways to consume your new Appwrite Functions.
</p>

<h2><a href="#domain" id="domain">Domain</a></h2>
<p>
    Each Appwrite function has its own domain. (can be custom)
    When requests are made to this link, whether through a browser or through an HTTP requests, 
    the request information like request headers and request body will be passed to the function.
    This unlocks interesting ways to integrate other apps and backends to your Appwrite project.

<h2><a href="#schedule" id="schedule">Schedule</a></h2>
<p>Appwrite supports scheduled function executions. You can schedule executions using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cron expressions</a> in the settings of your function. Cron supports recurring executions as frequently as <b>every minute</b>.</p>

<p>Here are some cron expressions for common intervals.</p>

<table class="full text-size-small">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <td>Cron Expression</td>
        <td>Schedule</td>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>*/15 * * * *</td>
        <td>Every 15 minutes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0 * * * *</td>
        <td>Every Hour</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0 0 * * *</td>
        <td>Every day at 00:00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0 0 * * 1</td>
        <td>Every monday at 00:00</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>
    Appwrite Functions can be executed using Client or Server SDKs. 
    Client SDKs must be authenticated with an account that has been granted execution <a href="/docs/permissions">permissions</a> on the function's settings page. 
    Server SDKs require an API key with the correct scopes.
</p>
<p>
    If your function with a generated or custom domain, permissions are disabled for this function.
    Anyone visiting this domain will be able to execute the function.
    If you need to enforce permissions for functions with a domain, use authentication methods like JWT.
